# dead-by-daylight-grid-game

A simple grid-based game where the player navigates through the grid to avoid the killer, with obstacles like pallets, bushes, and generators blocking the path inspired by the popular horror game Dead by Daylight. 

## Features
- A player-controlled character that can move in a 10x10 grid.
- A killer that moves around the grid and ends the game if the player is adjacent to it.
- Objects placed randomly in the grid, such as pallets, bushes, and generators.

## How to Play
1. **Move the Player**: Use the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move the player up, left, down, or right.
2. **Objective**: Avoid being adjacent to the killer. If you do, the game will end with a "Game Over" alert.
3. **Obstacles**: You cannot move through pallets or generators.
